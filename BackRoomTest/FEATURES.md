# Shelbourne FC Academy — Feature Breakdown

> Detailed breakdown of what is functionally implemented vs. decorative UI only.

---

## Squad Management

**File:** `src/pages/demo/shelbourne/admin/SquadManagement.tsx`

- **Display only** — players are rendered from static seed data (`shelPlayers`), not from shared state
- **Add Player button** — button exists in the UI but has no handler; clicking it does nothing
- **Filter button** — exists but does nothing
- **Search input** — renders but has no `onChange` handler; does not filter
- **View button** — per player, exists but does nothing
- **Overflow menu** (⋮) per squad — exists but does nothing
- **Stats shown** — live counts of active / injured / recovery players and total coaching staff
- **Coaching staff** — listed per squad as read-only badges

> **Summary: read-only view. No add, delete, edit, or search is functional.**

---

## IDP Management — Admin

**File:** `src/pages/demo/shelbourne/admin/IDPManagement.tsx`

- **Search** — fully functional, filters by player name
- **Squad filter** — fully functional, filters by age group
- **Two tabs:**
  - `By Squad` — lists all IDPs with progress bars
  - `Engagement Overview` — squad averages + "Players Needing Attention" list
- **No create/delete** from this view — admin can only observe, not edit
- **Stats** — live computed: total IDPs, on track, at risk, reviews due, average progress across all squads
- **Progress colour coding** — green ≥70%, amber 40–70%, red <40%

---

## IDP Management — Coach

- **Attention Required** — shows red-flagged players with their notes
- **Per-player bar chart** — 5 metrics displayed as proportional bars per player
- **7-day trend chart** — static seed data bar chart (not from live check-ins)
- **No editing** — coach view only

## Daily Check-in — Player

**File:** `src/pages/demo/shelbourne/player/DailyCheckin.tsx`

The most fully interactive player feature. A 4-step wizard:

| Step | Content |
|---|---|
| **1 — Wellness** | 5 sliders (sleep quality, nutrition, hydration, recovery, mood), each rated 1–5 |
| **2 — Nutrition** | Breakfast / lunch / dinner (yes / skipped), snacks (healthy / mixed / processed), water intake slider (0–4L in 0.5L steps) |
| **3 — Sleep** | Hours slept slider (3–12h), bedtime time input, wake time input, optional notes to coach |
| **4 — Review** | Summary of all entries before submitting |

### On Submit:
- Computes `overallLevel` (green / amber / red) based on feedback scoring
- Saves `WellnessCheckin` to shared context — **immediately visible in coach's Wellness Data view**
- Displays personalised feedback per metric (e.g. if <7h sleep, a specific guidance message is shown)
- Shows overall summary card
- Displays a 5-day streak badge (hardcoded)

> **Note:** Hardcoded to player Aaron Connolly (`playerId: 'sb13'`)

## Planning Overview — Admin

**File:** `src/pages/demo/shelbourne/admin/PlanningOverview.tsx`

- **Squad filter buttons** — exist but do nothing

---

## Monitoring — Admin

## Education Hub, Video Library, Settings, Upskilling

**Files:** `admin/EducationHub.tsx`, `admin/VideoLibrary.tsx`, `admin/Settings.tsx`, `admin/UpskillingAftercare.tsx`, `coach/Education.tsx`, `coach/VideoAnalysis.tsx`, `coach/UpskillingAftercare.tsx`

All of these are **static display pages** — no interactive CRUD. Buttons and forms render but have no handlers. Data shown is either hardcoded or from static seed arrays.
